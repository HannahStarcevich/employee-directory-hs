# Employee-Directory_HS
  
## Description
This employee directory is a full stack web app built on React. A global company would use this platform to show all employee contact details, allow users to search for specific people, locate the selected individual on a map and reach out to them via email to connect. 

Please note: Because this site uses a free mock employee database API in which data is a bit faulty, the coordinate do not match the addresses listed per each fake user. The Google Maps API shown here accurately renders the false coordinates, working as expected.
